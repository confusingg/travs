### Should I visit Oslo?

Oslo is beautiful, clean, friendly, diverse, cold, expensive (to non-Norwegians) and, to be honest, a little bit boring. Perfect for some, terrible for others. There are some gems of cuisine, architecture and culture and anyone will spend a few costly days here without much trouble. Any longer and you should probably combine the city with a trip to the wilderness. Norway's got a lot of that.

### How about travel?

Alright. Here's the basic stuff.

#### Getting there

##### Flying into Oslo

Oslo's main airport (OSL) is in [Gardermoen](https://avinor.no/en/airport/oslo-airport/), and most large European airlines fly there. A few also fly to [Sandefjord](https://www.torp.no/) (TRF) airport which is more than 100km away from Oslo. While Wikipedia's airlines and destinations lists for [OSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Airport,_Gardermoen#Airlines_and_destinations) and [TRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandefjord_Airport,_Torp#Airlines_and_destinations) can be useful, the basic point is that travel to Oslo is 



There's a service called [Flytoget](https://flytoget.no/) which offers overpriced trains that are only a little bit quicker than local trains, so ignore it.

##### Sea

Ferries arrive into Oslo from Denmark with [DFDS](https://www.dfds.com/en) and Germany with [Color Line](https://www.colorline.de/). It's slow, so only do this if you don't like to fly.
