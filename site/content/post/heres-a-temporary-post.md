### TL;DR

Oslo is beautiful, clean, friendly, diverse, cold, expensive (to non-Norwegians) and, to be honest, a little bit boring. Perfect for some, terrible for others. There are some gems of cuisine, architecture and culture and anyone will spend a few costly days here without much trouble. Any longer and you should probably combine the city with a trip to the countryside or, further afield, the mountains.
